          <h4>During WiCHacks 2024, three developers created "That Feeling When" to promote mental health through the use of music. Music therapy is the clinical use of music to achieve goals like reducing stress, improving mood and expressing yourself. Users are allowed to collaborate on playlists based on what they are going through to improve their mental health, and build connections with women and gender minorites around the world.</h4>
